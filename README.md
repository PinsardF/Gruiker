# Gruiker
*School Project : Mobile Programming (ESIEA 4th Year)*
You stay on your phone all day looking at tweets ; but have you thought about your pet who feels bored and alone ?
Of course, some people would recommand to spend less time on your phone and take care of your pet. But of course, they're wrong !
The solution has a name, and this name is Gruiker !

Your pet is too lazy to learn your language, so why not provide him tweets in his own language ? This is what Gruiker is all about.
Firstly designed for pigs (because who doesn't have a pig as a pet ?), you can create any language you want. So whatever your pet could be, he will get able to read tweets just like you !
How cool is that ?
